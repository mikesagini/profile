<p><b><i>The Power Of Positive Thinking</b></i><br></br>
If you are determined to be successful, you need to be aware of how to overcome situations and maintain a positive attitude. Being optimistic in different areas of your life including the aspect of wealth that enables you to have high expectations. If youbelieve that you can achieve something, the power of the mind and positive thoughts will lead you towards your expectations.
Observing life from apositive perspective gives you the ability not only to achieve your goals but to exceed your expectations. People who are pessimistic or lack motivation have a tendency to keep their expectations low, avoid challenging situations or keep on repeating the same mistakes.

<p><b><i>Tips To Success</b></i><br></br>Do the usual work in a different way: Take a project or assignment you already do and use one tool to give the project a digital twist.
Use the tools to learn: Don’t learn just to use the tools.
Engage in meaningful assessment: Assess the work against skills and content learning, not by the finished product.
Expect chaos: You are the nexus of chaos, so develop procedures to minimize the number of students clamoring for your help.
Expect Murphy’s Law: Anything that can go wrong probably will.
Acknowledge your students as resources: You’ve heard the saying, “And the children shall lead you.” It’s truer than ever.

<p><b><i>Stop Wasting Your Time Complaining</b></i><br></br> 
“People visit a wise man complaining about the same problems over and over again. One day, he decided to tell them a joke and they all roared with laughter.

After a few minutes, he told them the same joke and only a few of them smiled.

Then he told the same joke for a third time, but no one laughed or smiled anymore.

The wise man smiled and said: ‘You can’t laugh at the same joke over and over. So why are you always crying about the same problem?'”

<p><b><i>Create A Sense Of Urgency</b></i><br></br>An atmosphere of urgency will create an atmosphere of achievement.

Have you noticed that the people who make things happen in this world value and share the same sense of urgency?

High Achievers work best under a self-determined or externally fixed deadline for achieving objectives. Those who consciously choose not to “sleep at the wheel” realize that regardless of the goal being pursued, they must continually maintain a sense of urgency in order to compete and win.

<div id="div6">
<p><b><i>"A curious mind is a successful mind. Ask the right questions. Always seek answers."</b></i><br></br>The beauty of thought is that it can take you everywhere and anywhere. A truly free mind can never be held captive</p>
