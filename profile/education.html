PERSONAL PROFILE
My enthusiasm for information Technology includes both the workings of the technology itself and the uses of which it can be put in the modern world. A long-standing interest in computer and electronics has given me a good knowledge of programming languages and my school and course has introduced me to immense value of database, web technology and multimedia facilities.
